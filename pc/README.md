### 📢 About group 

Welcome to **Antibook** — the first private Facebook group where you get:

🔐 Encrypted content — text and images are protected. **Facebook sees nothing. You see everything!**\
🗣️ True freedom of speech — write what actually matters to you,
without fear of moderation or complaints from FB.\
👀 Only members can decrypt — no leaks, no outsiders. Just us.\
🚀 Memes, thoughts, and words the algorithm fears — now safe inside.\
🤫 It's a safe space for those who love words like: n-word, k-word etc

### ⚔️ How to be a member of the group
- **You must be a desktop user.** You cannot encrypt or decrypt content in our group if you use Facebook as an app or access Facebook through the mobile version of Google Chrome. The mobile version of Google Chrome does not support extensions.
- **[Download my extension for google chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/antibook/aindhnpclfmghkneeijdloelinkfbpgk)** that decrypts and decrypts content (text and images)
- **Pay 5 euros for a monthly membership**. WTF??? Why??? Calm down, calm down!\
[ *It's FREE now (06.2025), because it is a test period and a small number of users. That is why the load on the computing power of the server processor is insignificant.* ] \
Here are the reasons:
	- 📌 Amazon server fee.
	The content is partially encrypted and decrypted there.
	- 📌 Protection from bots and provocateurs. Only interested people will form the community.
	- 📌 All extra money will be spent on food for stray cats and dogs. 🐱 🐶

### ⚙️ How it works

The plugin encrypts only text and images. **Video is not encrypted!**

Before the user sends a post to Facebook, the plugin encrypts the content in the background.
If it is text, it will look like Japanese hieroglyphs in a chaotic order.
If it is a picture, then after encryption, it will look like randomly mixed blocks.

Neither AI nor a person will be able to understand what is depicted in the picture or what is contained in the text.
After that, the post will be sent to Facebook.
Thus, the text and pictures are stored on Facebook in encrypted form.

To decrypt the text or picture, the user must click on it. And the plugin will decrypt it.
When you click on a picture in the feed, most pictures will have small white gaps between the blocks, this happens because Facebook cuts the sent picture into different sizes for the extensions of different devices. And therefore the decryption process cannot be perfect (google what it means - pixel interpolation).
If you want a picture in better quality, then click on it again so that it opens in a larger size and click again to decrypt.


### ⚔️ Rules:
\
🚫 **Prohibited:**
- **All content (except videos) is encrypted automatically**, even if you post nothing prohibited. This is how it should be.
*You cannot publish unencrypted content by disabling the plugin!*
- Content depicting or encouraging violence against animals or people - in any form (video, photo, text).
- Propaganda of any religion
- Advertising without the consent of the admin.

✅ **Allowed and encouraged:**
- Freedom of expression - without censorship. You can use words like nigger, kike etc.
- Truth in any form.
- Humor in any form, including intolerant.
- Porn pictures as part of a meme.

### 🪳What is not a bug

- When you click on a picture in a comment and a new window opens. And you click on the description of this picture or on the picture itself, then the text and picture will be encrypted, **even if it does not relate to our group**.
**Click again and decryption will occur**.\
*Why does this happen?!* \
Because Facebook does not allow us to understand at the software level whether the comment relates to our group or not. That is why encryption and decryption have to be applied to all comments that open in a new window
- The text in the post cannot be bold, italicized or quoted. The plugin will automatically convert it to plain text.
