### ‚öîÔ∏è How to be a member of the group
- **You must be a desktop user.** You cannot encrypt or decrypt content in our group if you use Facebook as an app or access Facebook through the mobile version of Google Chrome. The mobile version of Google Chrome does not support extensions.
- **Download my extension for google chrome** that decrypts and decrypts content (text and images) [--->link for downloading]
- **Pay 5 euros for a monthly membership**. Why???
	- Amazon server fee.
	The content is partially encrypted and decrypted there.
	- Protection from bots and provocateurs. Only interested people will form the community.
	- All extra money will be spent on food for stray cats and dogs.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How it works
The plugin encrypts only text and images. **Video is not encrypted!**

Before the user sends a post to Facebook, the plugin encrypts the content in the background.
If it is text, it will look like Japanese hieroglyphs in a chaotic order.
If it is a picture, then after encryption, it will look like randomly mixed blocks.

Neither AI nor a person will be able to understand what is depicted in the picture or what is contained in the text.
After that, the post will be sent to Facebook.
Thus, the text and pictures are stored on Facebook in encrypted form.

To decrypt the text or picture, the user must click on it. And the plugin will decrypt it.
When you click on a picture in the feed, most pictures will have small white gaps between the blocks, this happens because Facebook cuts the sent picture into different sizes for the extensions of different devices. And therefore the decryption process cannot be perfect (google what it means - pixel interpolation).
If you want a picture in better quality, then click on it again so that it opens in a larger size and click again to decrypt.
